# CryptoClustering

For this assignment, I was able to do it all myself using class recordings and activities. However, for the last part of the assignment that required me to create composite plots, comparing the original elbow chart to the new one, and the original cluster chart and the new one, I could not figure out how to do it. I could not find it in any of the class recordings or activity files.
